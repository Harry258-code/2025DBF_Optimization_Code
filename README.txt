Score_Prediction.m is the only relevant file for working through configuration and setting limits. This is the file to run to get top three (or more) configurations. 

Other details can be changed in the maxSpeed.m class: fuselage type (cross section and payload capacity), Airfoil, and landing gear type.

Any file with sense in the name outlines mission scoring as parameters change.
